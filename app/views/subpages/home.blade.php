					Built at his own apartment by <a href="https://github.com/rmobis">@rmobis</a>, Most Wanted utilizes
					<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://four.laravel.com">
					Laravel 4</a>, and is managed through <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to help nerds do
					awesome wars on Tibia.

				<h2>Made for very few.</h2>
				<p>
					Most Wanted was made not only to look awesome, but also to teach those IE bastards what a real
					browser is. Get out of my site with that stinky browser!

				<h2>Simple, yet powerful.</h2>
				<p>
					Our main focus was to make Most Wanted simple to use while keeping it powerful and allowing users to
					get the best out of it. <b>Achievement unlocked.</b>
